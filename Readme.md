### 2. 🎨 Canvas API

- Renders interactive traffic heatmaps and flow lines
- Plots real-time traffic markers with zoom/pan support
- Uses color gradients to represent congestion levels

### 3. 🟣 Background Tasks API

- Performs route optimizations and traffic calculations during idle time
- Ensures UI remains smooth even during data-heavy operations

### 4. 📡 Network Information API

- Detects connection quality (2G/3G/4G/WiFi)
- Adapts data sync frequency based on network status
- Supports offline functionality with local caching

### 5. 🔔 Notifications API

- Displays real-time push alerts for congestion or incidents
- Includes vibration support via Vibration API for mobile devices

### 6. 🎙️ Speech Recognition API

- Allows voice commands like “show fastest route”, “refresh traffic”, “clear map”
- Hands-free user experience
