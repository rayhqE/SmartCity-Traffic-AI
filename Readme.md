# Smart City Traffic Monitor & Visualizer

## Overview

The Smart City Traffic Monitor & Visualizer is an AI-powered web application designed to provide real-time traffic insights, predictions, and optimized route suggestions for urban environments. It leverages various modern Web APIs to deliver a rich, interactive, and responsive user experience, helping users navigate cities more efficiently and safely.

## Features

This application integrates several advanced features to enhance traffic monitoring and user experience:

*   **Real-time Location Tracking**: Utilizes the Geolocation API for precise, continuous user location updates.
*   **Dynamic Traffic Visualization**: Employs the Canvas API to render interactive traffic heatmaps, flow animations, and incident markers.
*   **AI-Powered Traffic Prediction**: A machine learning model (simulated) predicts future congestion levels based on historical data, weather, and events.
*   **Smart Route Optimization**: Suggests the fastest, eco-friendly, or scenic routes by analyzing real-time traffic data and user preferences.
*   **Background Data Processing**: Uses the Background Tasks API (`requestIdleCallback`) to perform heavy computations (like traffic analysis and model training) without blocking the main thread, ensuring a smooth UI.
*   **Network Information Monitoring**: Adapts data loading and user experience based on network connection quality using the Network Information API.
*   **Intelligent Alert System**: Provides real-time notifications for high congestion, incidents, and clear routes, with support for browser push notifications and haptic feedback.
*   **Social Traffic Reports**: Allows users to submit and view community-sourced traffic incidents and conditions, enhancing real-time awareness.
*   **Advanced Filtering**: Provides comprehensive filters for road type, congestion level, time range, speed, and incident display to customize the map view.
*   **Personalized Dashboard**: Offers user-specific statistics, travel patterns, and customizable preferences (e.g., preferred route type, notifications).
*   **Voice Commands**: Integrates Speech Recognition API for hands-free control and navigation.
*   **Enhanced UI/UX**: Features a modern, responsive design with glassmorphism effects, subtle animations, and intuitive controls built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.

## Technologies Used

*   **Next.js**: React framework for building full-stack web applications.
*   **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.
*   **shadcn/ui**: Reusable UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Lucide React**: A collection of beautiful and customizable open-source icons.
*   **Web APIs**:
    *   **Geolocation API**: For location tracking.
    *   **Canvas API**: For dynamic traffic visualization.
    *   **Intersection Observer API**: For performance optimization and animations.
    *   **Network Information API**: For network quality monitoring.
    *   **Background Tasks API (`requestIdleCallback`)**: For non-blocking data processing.
    *   **Notifications API**: For browser push notifications.
    *   **Speech Recognition API**: For voice commands.
    *   **Vibration API**: For haptic feedback on mobile devices.
    *   **Web Storage API (localStorage)**: For user preferences persistence.

## Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (version 18 or higher)
*   npm or Yarn or pnpm

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository (or extract the zip file):**
    If you downloaded a zip, extract it to your desired directory. If it's a Git repository, clone it:
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd smart-traffic-monitor
    \`\`\`

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary packages:
    \`\`\`bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    \`\`\`

3.  **Run the development server:**
    Start the Next.js development server:
    \`\`\`bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    \`\`\`

4.  **Open in your browser:**
    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is in use).

## Usage

Once the application is running:

*   **Location Tracker**: Click "Start Tracking" to enable real-time location updates. This will also trigger traffic data generation around your simulated location.
*   **Tabs**: Navigate through the different sections (Monitor, Routes, AI Predict, Analytics, Social, Personal) using the tabs at the top.
*   **Traffic Canvas**: Observe the simulated traffic flow, congestion, and incidents. You can pan and zoom the map.
*   **AI Predictor**: See future traffic predictions and model accuracy.
*   **Route Optimizer**: Get optimized route suggestions based on various criteria.
*   **Alert System**: Receive simulated alerts for traffic conditions.
*   **Social Reports**: Submit your own traffic reports and view others' contributions.
*   **Advanced Filters**: Use the filter options to customize the data displayed on the map and in other sections.
*   **Voice Commands**: Toggle voice commands on/off and try speaking commands like "show traffic", "find route", or "check alerts".
*   **Personalized Dashboard**: Adjust your preferences and view your travel statistics and achievements.
